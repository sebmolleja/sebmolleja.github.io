      <h1>Co-op Work Term 1</h1>
      <h4>University of Guelph, Research Assistant - Food Science</h4>

      <h2>Abstract/Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        For my first work term in the summer of 2023, I was given the unique
        opportunity from the University of Guelph to contribute to the
        Triglyceride Property Calculator as a Software Developer under Alejandro
        G. Marangoni in the Food Science. This website will go over the details
        of my time at this job, the employer, and my overall experience.
      </p>

      <h2>Information About The Department of Food Science</h2>
      <p>
        The Department of Food Science at the University of Guelph conducts a
        diverse range of research in areas such as food chemistry, food
        microbiology, and food product development. It also offers undergraduate
        and graduate programs and courses in food science in technology. I was
        lucky enough to join a brilliant team under Dr. Marangoni and meet other
        bright students working and researching in this field. Dr. Marangoniâ€™s
        work specializes in the physical properties of foods and the fat
        crystallization and structure and his team predominantly works on
        creating innovative plant based foods such as cheese, ice cream, and
        chocolate. The likes of data modeling and web development are strongly
        used to transform some of the existing models of fat crystallization
        into working software that will be used by future chemists and food
        scientists.
      </p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>

      <h3>Creativity</h3>

      <div style="align-items: center">
        <p>
          I knew that the tasks that were ahead of me during this work term
          would be difficult considering my current experience and circumstances
          so I made it a goal to get creative in my learning and use different
          or new resources. I also wanted to tie this in practicing my critical
          thinking skills to and utilize my creativity to contribute wherever I
          could.

          <i class="fab fa-solid fa-code-branch fa-5x" style="padding-left: 0.5rem" ></i>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Problem Solving</h3>

      <div style="align-items: center">
        <p>
          I used a lot of Python and many data tailored packages through my day
          to day work and I knew that in the beginning I was not completely
          comfortable in writing Python code since it was very new to me at the
          time. I made it a goal to get comfortable in this language as it would
          not only help me during work but set me up for the future as it would
          enhance how efficiently I could solve technical problems. In terms of
          the wide variety of packages in Python I was very keen on working with
          numpy and pandas. By the end of my term I was very content with how
          much I used these technologies.
        </p>
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
          <i class="fab fa-python fa-5x"></i>
          <i class="fab fa-solid fa-code fa-5x" aria-hidden="true" style="padding-left: 1rem"></i>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Teamwork</h3>

      <div style="align-items: center">
        <p>
          Apart from the technical side of working in tech I knew that soft
          skills play a huge role on how your team functions with you. I made
          sure that I learned to communicate effectively with my team and
          sharpen my explanation skills. As time went on I realized that
          organization ties into this heavily and made that added on to this
          goal.

          <i class="fab fa-solid fa-people-group fa-5x" style="padding-left: 1rem"></i>
        </div>
      </div>

      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Using this report as a reflection I believe I completed all of my goals
        but did miss out on some minor technical details. For instance, working
        with Flask was one task that was getting started a little late on our
        project due to scheduling issues
      </p>

      <h2>Job Description</h2>
      <p>
        The project I worked on during this term was a Triglyceride Property
        Calculator which is used to estimate the melting points and enthalpies
        of triacylglycerides (TAGs). The app was originally developed in R back
        in 2017 by another team and left untouched since then. In this term it
        was my job to optimize the version of the app in R and also translate it
        to Python. After the optimization and translation of the app into the
        new language, I focused my work on implementing additional features to
        the existing Python version. Making the app more feasible to users,
        creating a more accurate computation, and updating the database were my
        main goals.
        <br />
        The most interesting part of this job was applying myself into a
        completely different field which I had very little knowledge in and
        tying it back into my computing background. Learning the theory behind
        the app and then writing software as the answer was a very unique and
        satisfying feeling that I didn't know this career could bring me. The
        base skills I needed for this job was past full stack development and a
        base understanding of systems which I learned both in classes and on my
        own time but my understanding and confidence grew considerably by
        everyday practice on the job.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <p>
        My time contributing to the Triglyceride Property Calculator was a very
        new and fun experience. I created many amazing memories with my
        supervisor and colleagues. I learned a substantial amount and it is
        knowledge that I will carry with me throughout my career. This being my
        first job in this industry, the experience was incredible and I plan to
        keep in touch with the amazing people in the Food Science department at
        the University of Guelph.
      </p>

      <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
      <p>
        I would like to express my deep gratitude to the University of Guelph
        for providing opportunities like this one. More specifically, I would
        like to thank Dr. Marangoni for guiding me and mentoring me throughout
        the entire work term. I appreciate my colleagues and The Cheese Team for
        being so supportive each day and creating amazing memories.
