      <h1>Co-op Work Term 2</h1>
      <h4>University of Guelph, Software Developer Intern - Greenbug Energy</h4>

      <h2>Abstract/Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        For the second half of my first work term I earned the opportunity to
        work in the Engineering Department and the University of Guelph as a
        Software Developer Intern. The team I had joined was working on a
        Archimedes Screw Project in collaboration with a company called Greenbug
        Energy to produce a web application for users to scale their Screw plans
        within software implementation. This tab will go over my experience over
        the 4 months I was there.
      </p>

      <h2>Information About The Team and Greenbug Energy</h2>
      <p>
        Greenbug Energy specializes in creating, producing, installing,
        managing, and servicing Archimedes screw generators designed for low
        head micro hydro sites and other industrial energy recovery applications
        ranging from 1 to 500kW in capacity. They currently work in
        collaboration with a research team in the Engineering Department at the
        University of Guelph to develop and implement software solutions that
        offer their work to customers via an interactive web application.
      </p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>

      <h3>Depth and Breadth of Understanding</h3>

      <div style="align-items: center">
        <p>
          My primary goal was to attain proficiency in the Django framework, a
          tool integral to our daily work for building Greenbugâ€™s Energy
          full-stack application. To achieve this, I was consistently diving
          into our codebase, analyzing project structures, and seeking clarity
          through questions. I continuously committed to setting weekly learning
          goals within my personal tasks, ensuring a steady progression in
          understanding Django's concepts and features. At the end of my term I
          feel very comfortable in creating Django apps following the best
          coding practices and effectiveness.

        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Problem Solving</h3>

      <div style="align-items: center">
        <p>
          In my role, Python and Docker were pivotal technologies. My aim was to
          elevate my proficiency in Python by learning diverse techniques from
          colleagues, not only for job enhancement but also to sharpen
          problem-solving skills. While Docker is less utilized, I was very
          determined to acquire valuable knowledge by following a colleague's
          footsteps in its setup. By the term's end, I plan to apply this newfound
          Docker expertise to various projects, using my free time to experiment
          and actively tackling issues related to Docker and Python in my daily
          work for practical learning.

      <h3>Teamwork and Communication</h3>

      <div style="align-items: center">
        <p>
          Continual improvement in communication and teamwork soft skills are
          always key focus for me. Recognizing the collaborative nature of our
          goals, I did my best to strive to enhance my presentation and
          communication abilities, aiming to be a more effective team player.
          Leveraging tools like Teams and Trello, I actively engage in thorough
          planning and communication, ensuring clarity and alignment within the
          team. I've found that participating in calls for work discussions,
          clarification, and questions was the most effective approach to
          improving, and I'm committed to maintaining this practice in my next
          work terms.

      <h2>Job Description</h2>
      <p>
        I contributed to the latest version of Greenbug's primary application,
        Water Watts, which focused on simulating the creation, planning, and
        blueprinting of Archimedes Screw Pumps for construction. This
        comprehensive application incorporated building materials, specific
        parts, cost considerations, location details, and simulation of the
        projected pump. In the initial quarter of my tenure, our team was
        assigned the task of refactoring the older application and integrating
        it with another foundational system, consolidating both into the main
        app. Subsequently, my week-to-week responsibilities spanned the entire
        development spectrum, from front-end to back-end tasks. This included
        designing home pages, optimizing query time efficiencies, implementing
        asynchronous worker tasks, and more. The primary programming language
        utilized was Django, with additional application of Git, Docker, Unix,
        and Javascript throughout the term.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <p>In conclusion, my experience contributing to Greenbug Energy was both 
        challenging and rewarding. Over the course of the four months, I feel 
        very happy to have played a prominent role in the development of such an impactful application.
        The diverse range of tasks allowed me to develop a holistic understanding 
        of the development spectrum in the real world.
      
        Working with a talented team of bright individuals was a privilege, as their 
        mentorship and guidance enriched my learning experience. The utilization of 
        Django, JavaScript, along with tools such as Git, Docker and Unix, provided 
        a versatile and dynamic environment for problem-solving and innovation.

        I am more than grateful to have been a part of this team throughout these four
        months and I will take all the experience I gained with me forward and improve from it. 
      </p>

      <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
      <p>
        I would like to express my sincere thanks to everyone I was able to work with throughout the fall work term.
        More specially my close colleagues Catarina, Scott, and Dr. Lubitz. Your expertise, guidance, and mentorship
