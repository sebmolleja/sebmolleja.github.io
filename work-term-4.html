      <h1>Co-op Work Term 4</h1>
      <h4>ATS Corporation. Software Developer</h4>

      <h2>Abstract/Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        For my fourth work term, I had the opportunity to work at ATS Corporation, 
        a company that provides automation solutions worldwide. They specialize in 
        planning, designing, building, commissioning, and servicing automated manufacturing
        and assembly systems, including automation products and test solutions.
        I joined the Digital Analytics Team in the Innovation department as a Software Developer.
      </p>

      <h2>Information About The Innovation Team and ATS Corporation</h2>
      <p>
        I worked under ATS Life Sciences, a division of ATS Corporation that specializes 
        in automated manufacturing and assembly solutions for the medical, 
        pharmaceutical, and diagnostic industries. They provide end-to-end 
        automation to help MedTech and pharma 
        manufacturers bring life-changing products to market faster.
        <br />
        <br />
        They also integrate AI, cloud computing, 
        and digital twins to optimize manufacturing 
        efficiency and compliance, being the area where I contributed the most.
        <br />
        <br />
        I was involved in developing a full-stack web and 
        desktop application designed to streamline the 
        design and configuration of automation tooling. 
        It provided both internal teams and customers with an 
        intuitive platform to customize automation solutions 
        efficiently, enhancing productivity and precision in manufacturing processes.

      <h2>Goals</h2>

      <h3>Depth and Breadth of Understanding</h3>

      <div style="align-items: center">
        <p>
          My first goal was to develop a strong understanding of Entity Framework Core,
          ensuring I could use it effectively in our project. 
          To achieve this, I started with the basics through 
          hands-on practice, gradually diving into more advanced 
          concepts like optimization and testing. I actively sought 
          feedback from my team to refine my approach and improve my skills.
          Success was measured by my ability to implement Entity Framework 
          Core confidently, write well-structured queries, 
          and receive positive feedback from my team.
        </p>

        <p>
        Reflecting on my progress, I found that practical experience was invaluable
        in deepening my understanding. While learning the fundamentals was straightforward,
        optimizing queries and testing efficiently required more deliberate effort.
        Seeking feedback helped me identify areas for improvement, and I saw 
        tangible growth in both my confidence and proficiency. With continued 
        focus and refinement, I felt ready to contribute even more effectively
        to our project.
        </p>

        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Depth and Breadth of Understanding</h3>

      <div style="align-items: center">
        <p>
          My goal was to develop a solid understanding of React.js and its integration 
          with TypeScript. To achieve this, I studied React concepts and actively
          incorporated TypeScript into our projects. I also practiced advanced patterns
          by utilizing online resources and courses while consistently seeking feedback
          from my team. Success was measured by my ability to build frontend components
          using TypeScript and React, ensuring my code was clean, reusable, and met 
          best practices. Receiving positive feedback from my team and applying it
          to future implementations helped reinforce my learning.
        </p>

        <p>
          Reflecting on my journey, I found that grasping Reactâ€™s fundamentals was manageable, 
          but mastering TypeScript within the framework required more hands-on experience. 
          Using advanced patterns and continuously refining my code through feedback 
          made a significant difference. Over time, I became more confident in structuring 
          my components efficiently and writing scalable, maintainable code. 
          I can see tangible growth in my skills, and I feel prepared to 
          take on more complex challenges in our project.
        </p>

      <h3>Oral Communication</h3>

      <div style="align-items: center">
        <p>
          My goal was to explore future career options, gain a deeper understanding 
          of my interests, and envision where I could see myself in the future. 
          To achieve this, I engaged in monthly meetings with my team and supervisors,
          conducted research on various career paths aligned with my skills and passions,
          and sought advice from mentors and professionals in those fields. I also took
          time to reflect on my experiences, helping me better understand myself and 
          what I truly enjoy. Success was measured by gaining clarity on potential career
          paths, confidently identifying roles I aspire to, and receiving valuable 
          guidance from mentors in the workplace.
        </p>

        <p>
          Reflecting on this journey, I found that speaking with experienced
          professionals provided invaluable insights into different career paths.
          Researching and reflecting on my own strengths and interests helped me
          piece together a clearer vision of my future. While some roles initially
          seemed appealing, deeper exploration revealed better-aligned options 
          for my skills and aspirations. Through mentorship and self-discovery, 
          I now feel more confident in the direction I want to pursue and have 
          a greater sense of purpose in my career journey.
