      <h1>Co-op Work Term 3</h1>
      <h4>Rodan Energy Solutions Inc. Software Developer</h4>

      <h2>Abstract/Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        For my third work term, I had the opportunity to work at Rodan Energy
        Solutions as a Software Developer. I joined the Energy Management
        Information System (EMIS) team, where I had the unique chance to
        contribute to a new project called the Bid Automation API. This internal
        application streamlines access to the Ontario Energy Market, making it
        easier for market operators at our company to manage and adjust bids
        effectively.
      </p>

      <h2>Information About The EMIS Team and Rodan Energy</h2>
      <p>
        Since 2003, Rodan Energy Solutions has expanded from a local metering
        service provider into a leading energy management company across North
        America. We offer innovative solutions to large commercial and
        industrial energy users, as well as power distribution and generation
        companies.
        <br />
        <br />
        The EMIS team works on optimizing energy usage for facilities by
        implementing Energy Management Information Systems (EMIS). These systems
        help businesses, like hotels and universities, understand their energy
        consumption and find ways to use energy more efficiently without
        sacrificing comfort or performance.
        <br />
        <br />
        An EMIS allows for real-time monitoring of energy usage, helping to
        identify peak hours and areas of high consumption. With automatic
        alerts, it makes managing energy easier by notifying users of abnormal
        events, and it finds opportunities to save energy by analyzing data and
        providing actionable insights. Overall, the EMIS team helps businesses
        save money, improve efficiency, and reduce their environmental impact.
      </p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>

      <h3>Depth and Breadth of Understanding</h3>

      <div style="align-items: center">
        <p>
          One of my key goals was to develop a thorough understanding of C#, as
          this was my first time working with the language. I wanted to dive
          deep into its core concepts, explore best practices, and gain the
          confidence to apply it effectively in the projects I was working on.
          By attempting to master C#, I aimed to strengthen my overall
          programming skills and broaden my technical expertise. After the term
          was complete I feel as if I got to a very solid level of understanding
          and a great level to build upon and improve in the future of my
          career.
        </p>

      <h3>Depth and Breadth of Understanding</h3>

      <div style="align-items: center">
        <p>
          One of my goals was to gain a solid understanding of the ASP.NET Core
          framework. I focused on exploring its features, learning how to build
          scalable applications, and applying that knowledge to real-world
          projects such as the Bid Automation RESTful API. By working through
          various aspects of the framework, I strengthened my skills in building
          web applications using modern, efficient techniques. I was lucky
          enough to have been working on a new project which had been started
          using .NET 8, the latest version of .NET core at the time which
          allowed me to learn and use new cutting edge tech.

      </div>

      <h3>Oral Communication</h3>

      <div style="align-items: center">
        <p>
          A goal of mine was to improve my oral communication skills within my
          software development team. Effective communication is essential for
          discussing project requirements, collaborating on technical solutions,
          and addressing challenges as they arise. By clearly articulating my
          ideas and actively listening to others, I aim to help ensure that my
          team stays aligned with my work, resolves issues efficiently, and
          delivers high-quality software. Strengthening my communication skills
          will also enhance collaboration during team meetings, code reviews,
          and project updates. I feel as if I continuously work towards this and
          focuses on how well my communication was with my other teams members.
          Receiving feedback on tihs goal and working off of it was essential.

      <h2>Job Description</h2>
      <p>
        As the principal developer of the Bid Automation API, I led the creation
        of a .NET 8 Web API that communicates with the IESO, streamlining market
        operations and enabling operators to easily modify bids within the
        market window. I developed over 13 RESTful endpoints using ASP.NET Core,
        deploying them with Swagger to enhance usability for internal market
        operators. Additionally, I leveraged Microsoft Azure services to
        authenticate users and securely store confidential data in Azure Key
        Vault, improving security for more than 25 market participants. I also
        played a key role in designing the APIâ€™s database architecture using
        Enterprise Architect, facilitating the persistence of bid transactions
        to a SQL Server database.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <p>
        In conclusion, I had an incredible experience working at Rodan Energy.
        It was the most I have learnt about my field and sofware in such a small
        window of time. I appreciate everyone there who allowed me to work with
        them and greatly thank them for giving me such a fantastic opportunity.
        I would 100% go back and continue the work I was doing and contributing
        to the amazing impactful project and work they do.
      </p>

      <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
      <p>
        I would like to acknowledge everyone at Rodan Energy Mississauga
        Headquarters that I was able to meet and collaborate with. I greatly
        appreciate everyone I was able to work with and learn from with a
        variety of diverse backgrounds and skillsets. More specifically I would
        like to thank my manager George for being especially understanding and
        providing a figure of guidance for me. I will also like to thank Brian
        for being such a direct mentor to the work I was doing and allowing me
        to grow and learn under his expertise. I will also like to thank the
        entire EMIS and dev team.
