      <h1>Co-op Work Term 5</h1>
      <h4>Magnet Forensics. Software Developer</h4>

      <h2>Abstract/Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        For my fifth and final work term, I joined the Automate Team at Magnet Forensics as a Software Developer.
        I had the opportunity to work on a full-stack web and desktop applicaiton designed to streamline fornesic workflows.
        This application provided criminal investigators and digital forensics professionals with 
        an intuitive platform to manage and analyze digital evidence efficiently.
      </p>

      <h2>Information About The Automate team and Magnet Forensics</h2>
      <p>
        Magnet Automate helps digital forensic labs work faster by automating evidence processing—like imaging,
        analyzing, and exporting data. The main idea with this is so that investigators can focus on solving cases instead of doing repetitive tasks. 
        It runs 24/7, handles multiple cases at once, and gives clear dashboards to track progress and lab performance.
        <br />
        <br />
        Magnet Forensics as a company builds tools that help law enforcement and 
        other agencies recover and analyze digital evidence from devices like phones 
        and computers. Their goal is to make investigations quicker, 
        more efficient, and more collaborative.

      <h2>Goals</h2>

      <h3>Depth and Breadth of Understanding</h3>

      <div style="align-items: center">
        <p>
          This first goal focused on developing independence and deeper understanding 
          through critical and creative thinking. The aim was to complete three regular
          development tickets from our kanban without relying on guidance, showing confidence in 
          navigating the codebase and solving problems solo. By documenting learnings
          from earlier tickets, the plan was to build a personal knowledge base to 
          support future tasks. Success was measured by completing three tickets
          entirely by myself, demonstrating growth in technical and problem-solving skills.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the start, things moved slowly as I adjusted to the software development 
          cycle at Magnet. After getting more and more familiar with the codebase it took about a month to feel truly 
          comfortable. Once I hit that stride, I stopped limiting myself to any specific 
          area and began picking up tickets across different parts of the application. 
          That flexibility helped me grow quickly, and I ended up completing far more 
          than just three tickets independently. It was a clear turning point in building
          confidence and becoming a more versatile contributor.
        </p>

      <h3>Depth and Breadth of Understanding</h3>

      <div style="align-items: center">
        <p>
          My second goal was about building foundational knowledge of Jenkins 
          and understanding its role within our application and generally to apply to future work. 
          The plan involved learning through my mentor. Since Jenkins wasn’t
          actively changing and required commonly on a day to day I took a more guided walkthrough at first than 
          hands-on work towards the end. The focus was on grasping its core functions,
          benefits, limitations, and how it supports the development workflow.
          Success meant being able to explain Jenkins clearly and identify where it could be applied in future projects.
        </p>

        <p>
          I had several one-on-one sessions with my mentor where we 
          explored how Jenkins is integrated into our application, 
          using real examples to break down its concepts and workflows. 
          These conversations helped me build a solid foundation and gave me clarity
          on its role in our development process. Later, 
          I picked up a few tickets related to build pipelines
          and configuration, which allowed me to apply what I’d
          learned in a hands-on way. Working directly with Jenkins deepened
          my understanding and made the learning experience much more practical and impactful.
        </p>

            style="width: 350px; height: 200px"
          />
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Oral Communication</h3>

      <div style="align-items: center">
        <p>
          This goal was centered on improving oral communication by
          stepping into leadership roles during team interactions. 
          The plan was to lead daily standups and deliver at least one
          TAD talk which is a tutorial-style presentation on a topic that could
          benefit the team. By joining the standup rotation and selecting
          relevant topics to present, the aim was to build confidence 
          and contribute knowledge. Success was defined by completing
          both tasks: leading a standup and giving a TAD talk.
        </p>

        <p>
        Leading multiple standups helped me build confidence in speaking
        up and sharing my own thoughts on team topics. 
        Over time, I became more comfortable contributing 
        ideas and facilitating discussions, which naturally
        led to deeper involvement in retrospectives, sprint planning,
        and team reflections. As my understanding of our workflows 
        and goals grew, I found myself participating more actively
        and meaningfully in these collaborative spaces.
        It was a great way to strengthen both my communication skills and my role within the team.

      <h2>Job Description</h2>
      <p>        
        Magnet Forensics offers a hands-on software development internship 
        where students are fully integrated into the team, contributing 
        real code to production and gradually taking on more complex features.
        The company values passionate problem solvers who thrive in 
        collaborative environments and are eager to grow both technically
        and personally. Their mission centers around building digital
        investigative tools that help protect communities and 
        support law enforcement worldwide.
        <ul>
          <li>Write production-level code and contribute to core features</li>
          <li>Emphasis on collaboration, mentorship, and continuous learning</li>
          <li>Focus on digital forensics across mobile, cloud, and computer platforms</li>
          <li>Embody Magnet CODE values: Care, Own, Dedicate, Evolve</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        I contributed to two releases of Magnet Automate,
        by developing scalable features across a tech stack that included React.js,
        .NET/Clojure services, and PostgreSQL. One key improvement involved 
        optimizing the case log viewer using React virtualization, 
        which significantly boosted load times by 53% and reduced browser 
        memory usage by 800 MB, directly addressing performance concerns
        raised by users. I also implemented end-to-end tests with Cypress,
        which helped lower the bug rate by 15% and improved overall
        system reliability.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <p>
        This work term marked a major milestone in my growth as a developer,
        building on everything I’ve learned across previous co-ops 
        and being my last. I’ve gained confidence in navigating complex systems, 
        collaborating with teams, and contributing meaningful code to production. 
        Each experience has sharpened my technical and communication skills, 
        and reinforced my passion for software development. I’m excited to 
        continue this journey, whether at Magnet Forensics or another 
        company, bringing curiosity, adaptability, and a drive to keep learning.
      </p>

      <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
      <p>
        I’m incredibly grateful to Jonathon, my team manager, 
        for his steady guidance and support throughout the term,
        and to Aniela, my mentor, for her patience and insight
        as I navigated new challenges. The entire Automate team—Kyle, 
        Brendan, Kieran, Sam, Ben, Brian, and Geoff—made the experience 
        both fun and rewarding, and I learned something valuable from 
        each of them. Their openness, collaboration, and willingness to 
        share knowledge made a huge impact on my growth. I truly hope to 
        cross paths with them again or stay in touch as I continue 
        my journey in software development.
